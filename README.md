# Decentralized-Inventory-Monitoring
Repository to store documents for application to the Minima Edge Pioneers Developers Programme

The intention of this project is to create a full PoC for a decentralised inventory monitoring infrastructure. This will encompass:

    - tamper proof RIFD tags built around the imminent chain-on-chip offering from the ARM Accelerator program
        + inc. scanner module linked to on-chain minidApp via Android/pi device
    - Minima smart contract
        + Token minting
        + Status updates (CREATED, IN_TRANSIT, IN_WAREHOUSE, BURNED)
        + Ownership transfers
        + Tamper events
    - Admin Dashboard â€“ minidApp for Lifecycle Tracking (block explorer?)
